# JurisPsql

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of JurisPsql is to provide functions to manipulate Brazilian legal databases from R.

Most of the functions are primarily concern with jurimetric needs not found in the `dbplyr` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version with:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("jjesusfilho/JurisPsql")
```

## Usage

I will be adding new functions little by little, but right now there is one very usufull function, which is the decision classifier.

``` r 

library(JurisPsql)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())

data(consumidor)

dplyr::copy_to(con,"consumidor",consumidor)

psql_classify_decision(con,"consumidor","julgado","decisao")
```
