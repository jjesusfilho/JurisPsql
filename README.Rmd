The goal of JurisPsql is to provide functions to manipulate Brazilian legal PostgreSQL databases from R.

Most of the functions are primarily concern with jurimetric needs not found in the `dbplyr` package.

## Installation

You can install the development version with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jjesusfilho/JurisPsql")
```

Obs. You must have a recent version of devtools installed, because this package imports my `tjsp` package which is only on Github.

## Usage

I will be adding new functions little by little, but right now there is one very useful function, which is the decision classifier.

``` r 

library(JurisPsql)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())

data(consumidor)

dplyr::copy_to(con,"consumidor",consumidor)

psql_classify_decision(con,"consumidor","julgado","decisao")
```

## Full-text search

I have implemented full-text search through the functions `psql_write_cjpg`, `psql_cjpg_tokenize`, and `psql_cjpg_query`. I still have some features to implement but they are working well and I really think that with PostgreSQL you have the best of both worlds, no need to use either elastic-search or solr.

This feature is particularly important to improve full-text search on whole-text decisions and also on panel opinions. 

Function `psql_write_cjpg` is not a replacement for `DBI::dbWriteTable`. This function will create a table, write a data.frame to it, create a primary key and create an inverted weighted index. So don't use it if you think is to much.

Depending on your PostgreSQL configuration it might take a long time if the number of documents is large. I have indexed 700.000 judicial decisions with minimal PostgreSQL config and it took several minutes.

```r
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())

psql_write_cjpg(con,"consumidor",consumidor)
```
Once the indexing is over, you can use function `psql_cjpg_query` to search for words or phrases the same way you do with any web search engine. You can also include it in your shinyapp to allow users to do search.
