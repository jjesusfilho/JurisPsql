The goal of JurisPsql is to provide functions to manipulate Brazilian legal PostgreSQL databases from R.

Most of the functions are primarily concern with jurimetric needs not found in the `dbplyr` package, but they are useful to whoever work texts too.

## Installation

You can install the development version with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jjesusfilho/JurisPsql")
```

Obs. You must have a recent version of devtools installed, because this package imports my `tjsp` package which is only available on Github.

## Usage

I will be adding new functions little by little, but right now there are two  very useful features, which are the decision classifier and the decision text search.

I have added a sample dataset of consumers' rights court decisions for you to play with the functions.

``` r 

library(JurisPsql)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())

data(consumidor)

dplyr::copy_to(con,"consumidor",consumidor)

psql_classify_decision(con,"consumidor","julgado","decisao")
```

## Decision-text search

I have implemented full-text search through the following functions:

-`psql_write_cjpg`: Creates a new table, writes a dataframe to it, creates a primary key to the table, creates an inverted weighted index on columns `assunto` and `julgado`, and also creates a trigger to reindex the same table 
every time the table is updated or gets inserted with new rows.

- `psql_cjpg_tokenize`: Creates an inverted weighted index from a cjpg table.

- `psql_cjpg_insert`: Inserts new rows to a table. The whole table is automatically reindexed once new rows
are inserted.

- `psql_cjpg_trigger`: Adds a trigger to a cjpg table to reindex it every time it gets updated or inserted with new rows.

- `psql_cjpg_query`: Queries words or phrases that same way you would do it with Google ou Bing.

I have worked with Elasticsearch and Solr before, but I am convinced that with PostgreSQL you have the best of the three worlds (sql, nosql and search engine), no need to use either nosql like Mongodb or search engines like Elasticsearch and Solr.

This feature is particularly important to improve full-text search on whole-text decisions and also on panel opinions (acórdãos in Portuguese). 

Depending on your PostgreSQL configuration it might take a long time if the number of documents is large. I have indexed 700.000 judicial decisions with minimal PostgreSQL config and it took several minutes.

```r
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres())

psql_write_cjpg(con,"consumidor",consumidor)
```
Once the indexing is over, you can use the function `psql_cjpg_query` to search for words or phrases the same way you do with any web search engine like Bing or Google. You can also include it in your shinyapp to allow users to do search.
